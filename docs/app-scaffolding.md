# App Scaffolding Instructions

Documenting the process of scaffolding a new app to my taste.

1. Scaffold using React Router 7 Template

```

```

- [x] `bunx create-react-router@latest spotify-playlist-builder`
- [x] Cleaned up the extra Dockerfiles and just kept `Dockerfile.bun`
- [x] Switched to [Tailwind 4 beta](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta). Had to upgrade to Vite 6 to get plugin to work.
